# Training | Gsap - Gsap-Workshop

This is a **Training | Gsap App** named **Gsap-Workshop**, developed using various modern web technologies.  
The app is designed to teach you how to use GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) in combination with React. 
The project was created with the help of the following tutorial from JS Mastery: [YouTube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRQbRAJ4-Fs&t=4066s).

## Technologies

### Frontend

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows for the development of reusable UI components and provides an efficient way to manage the application's state.

- **Vite**: A fast build tool and development server. Vite offers a blazing-fast development environment with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and optimized production builds.

- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**: A powerful JavaScript library for creating animations and transitions. GSAP is used to implement impressive and performant animations in the app.

### Other

- **JS Mastery**: The name of the channel or organization that provided the tutorial for creating this app. JS Mastery offers high-quality tutorials and learning resources for web development.

## Usage

This app serves as a training project to demonstrate the use of GSAP in a React application. You can explore the animations and transitions and learn how to effectively use GSAP in your own projects.

We hope this app helps you improve your web development and animation skills. Enjoy exploring and learning!




# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
